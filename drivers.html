                Charles Leclerc started his 2022 campaign in the best way possible. A win in the opening race in Bahrain, and a second win only two races
                later in Melbourne. After that, top finishes would have to wait for months due to competitors catching up alongside poor decisions from the management team.
                He would however win for a third time in Austria just a couple weeks before the summer break. A few months later, after a season long battle for 2nd place in the standings with Red Bull's
                Sergio Perez they shared 290 points each heading in to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Luckily for Charles, he managed to come 2nd, whilst Perez finished one spot
                behind in 3rd. Overall the season was a success, finishing 2nd behind Verstappen, even though early on, a chance at the title looked like a real possibility
                for the monegasque.

                Sainz's second season behind the Ferrari wheel was a real rollercoaster. The races where the spaniard manages to get to the finish line,
                the results were great, even if a couple more race wins was to be desired. It was however the six DNF's that really took him out of any title chances.
                A majority of these came by his own mistakes, but a few due to engine problems, most notably in Austria where a podium placing looked like a guarantee before
                the engine caught on fire. The 2022 season may not of been what Sainz had hoped for with Ferrari really having a competetive car this year, but he did pick up
                his first pole position as well as his first race win, so he won't leave this season completely empty handed. At the end Carlos finished 5th in the standings,
                just ahead of 7-time World Champion, Lewis Hamilton.
