This website is meant to display and recap the results and success that Ferrari's Formula 1 team had during the 2022 season. The website is targeted towards F1 fans in general and is a way to view the results for the Ferrari team all in the same place. 

Users of this website will be able to navigate to both the results of how all the teams did during the season along with a short recap discussing the results. Users can also navigate to a driver's page where both the Ferrari drivers individual results will be shown and discussed.

* I confirmed that all the links works as expected in the navigation menu as well as the footer social media links.

* I confirmed that all text, navigation, images etc. is easy to understand and easily readable.

* I confirmed that the form works as expected, except for the submit button, which I will mention in greater detail in the Unsolved bugs section.

# Bugs

### Solved bugs

* For a long time I had a bug where all the content of the page would be pushed right on smaller screen sizes. I could not understand why this happened until I found that I had quite large padding on my container elements. This caused the content to push outside the screen. 
    * To solve this, I simply removed the horizontal padding from the containers.

* HTML
    * No errors were found on either of the three pages when passing through the official W3C validator.
* CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

# Unsolved bugs

* When you click the submit button at the contact form page, a 405 Not Allowed message comes up. I would like to just have it refresh the page and say something along the lines of "Thank you for your submission".

# Credits

* To complete this project I used Code Inst√≠tute student template: [Gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* I used a specialized media queries module that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/gokulkrishh/242e68d1ee94ad05f488) to help me know the dimensions for common screen sizes and therefore be able to correctly make the website responsive.
* A lot of this website's inspiration has come from the CI [Love Running](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode/tree/main/08-responsive-elements/05-responsive-gallery) project.
* The footer section is also taking directly from the [Love Running](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode/tree/main/08-responsive-elements/05-responsive-gallery) project. However, the styling is done a little bit differently on this website.
* A user by the name of [Yusril Maulidan Raji](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3097810/yusril-maulidan-raji) on Stack Overflow, provided a way to style the radio buttons in the contact form. The question and answer was found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4253920/how-do-i-change-the-color-of-radio-buttons).
* All the information about the Ferrari team and information about the drivers was found on [F1's Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/).
* The official color used as background color for every team in the constructors table was found on [F1's Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/).

# Media 

* The driver and team photos used throughout the website are taken from [F1's Official Website](https://www.formula1.com/).
